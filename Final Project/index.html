         <h1>A JavaScript Array Tutorial</h1>
         <p id="titleP">A tutorial on JavaScript arrays presented in HTML by Robert Dobson.</p><br>
         <p>I have chosen to write a tutorial on JavScript arrays for the final assignment of my JavaScripting class which states "Your final assignment is to turn the tables and teach others what you've learned about JavaScript. Pick a favorite JavaScript topic and present a lesson using a page or series of web pages that fully teaches someone who may be interested in learning about that topic, and create a mini website for your tutorial. You must make use of JavaScript code snippets to provide valid examples of proper syntax. Code examples with errors in them will not earn full credit. For your code snippets make use of this JavaScript-based syntax highlighter library: https://highlightjs.org/download/<br>

         You must link to a page or provide working examples of what your tutorial is teaching. For example, if your tutorial is on JavaScript objects, your tutorial should provide working in-browser examples of how to make use of a JavaScript object or show output of the use of that JavaScript object."</p>
         <p>I have provided working in-browser examples of my demonstrated code in action courtesy of JSFiddle. Simply click the "Result" tab to see the code run, and the "JavaScript" tab to switch back to the code being demoed. I would also like to give credit and thanks to javascript.info for giving me ideas for presentation and code snippets to demonstrate.</p><br>
